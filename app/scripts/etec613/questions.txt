 
1] IN PLANNING AN EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY, I AM MOST LIKELY TO:
Clearly identify the results I want and develop a class or program that will achieve those results. [c]
Identify, with equal participation from learners, significant social, cultural, political and/or economic issues, and plan learning activities that will help learners contribute to social change. [h]
Begin by selecting content or subject matter that is likely to benefit learners for the rest of their lives. [a]
Assess learners' needs and develop practical learning activities based on those needs. [d]
Find out what is of greatest interest to learners and plan learning activities around those interests, even if I may not agree about their importance. [f]



2] PEOPLE LEARN BEST:
When new knowledge is presented from a problem-solving approach. [x]
When the learning activity is clearly structured and provides for practice and repetition. [w]
Through open discussion and critical reflection with others, both inside and outside of a structured learning environment. [z]
When they can make self-directed choices about learning methods and outcomes. [y]
From an "expert" who thoroughly knows the subject matter. [v]



3] THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF ADULT EDUCATION IS:
To facilitate the personal growth and development of each learner. [f]
To increase learners' awareness of the need for significant changes in our culture and society, and to enable them to contribution to such changes. [h]
To increase learners' knowledge and develop conceptual or theoretical understanding across a broad range of content, concepts, and principles. [a]
To increase the learners' capacity to solve everyday problems and fully participate in the society in which they live. [d]
To develop the learners' competency and mastery of specific knowledge and skills, so they can meet certain standards or expectations. [c]


4] THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS PEOPLE KNOW:
Are learned by studying or working cooperatively with others, solving problems along the way. [x]
Are learned through critical or reflective thinking focused on issues in our culture and society-past, present, and future. [z]
Are learned through a structured learning process or guided instruction that consistently helps them to find the right answers. [w]
Are gained through self-discovery rather than some "teaching" process. [y]
Are learned through a broad-based, comprehensive educational process rather than technical training or highly specialized education. [v]


5] DECISIONS ABOUT INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT SHOULD BE BASED ON:
Consultation with learners about what is most important and/or interesting to them. [f]
An assessment of what learners already know and what the teacher (or school/training organization) believes they should learn next. [c]
Current social, cultural, political, and/or economic situations and issues. [h]
A consideration of learners' "real-life" needs and problems outside the classroom. [d]
Generally agreed-upon content for a "well-rounded" education. [a]



6] GOOD ADULT EDUCATORS START PLANNING INSTRUCTION:
By considering the specific outcomes (knowledge, skills and attitudes) they are looking for and the most effective ways of achieving these outcomes. [w]
By identifying everyday problems that can be solved as a result of the instruction. [x]
By clarifying the content, concepts, and theoretical principles to be taught. [v]
By identifying social, cultural, political, and/or economic issues that affect the lives of the learners. [z]
By asking learners to identify what they want to learn and how they want to learn it. [y]


7] AS AN ADULT EDUCATOR, I AM MOST SUCCESSFUL IN SITUATIONS:
That are unstructured and flexible enough to follow learners' interests. [f]
That are well structured, with clear behavioral objectives and built-in feedback loops for learners. [c]
Where I can focus on practical skills and knowledge that can be put to use in solving real life problems. [d]
Where I can organize the subject matter in a logical way and build a solid foundation for future learning. [a]
Where the learners have some awareness of social, cultural, economic, and political issues and are willing to explore the impact of such issues on their daily lives. [h] 


8] IN PLANNING AN EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY, I TRY TO CREATE:
An opportunity for learners to make application of new knowledge, concepts, and skills to "real-world" situations. [x]
A setting in which learners are encouraged to examine their beliefs and values and to raise critical questions. [z]
A structured environment that keeps learners focused and moves them systematically toward the intended learning outcomes. [w]
A conceptual understanding of the breadth and depth of what is to be learned. [v]
A supportive climate that facilitates self-discovery and interaction. [y]


9] WHILE ENGAGED IN LEARNING, THE LEARNERS' FEELINGS:
Are crucial to the learning process and must be brought to the surface in order for adults to fully engage in any learning activity. [h]
Provide energy that can be focused on problems or questions. [d]
Reflect the uniqueness of each individual and should be expressed and valued in the learning process. [f]
Are handled effectively by the skillful adult educator to achieve the learning objectives. [c]
Are not as important as what learners are thinking. [a]


10] THE TEACHING METHODS I PREFER TO USE:
Focus on problem-solving and present real challenges to the learner. [x]
Emphasize practice and offer constructive feedback so that learners can get the right answers and learn essential skills. [w]
Are mostly non-directive, encouraging people to take responsibility for their own learning. [y]
Involve learners in discussion and critical examination of controversial issues. [z]
Are designed primarily to help learners improve their thinking and reasoning abilities. [v]


11] WHEN LEARNERS ARE UNINTERESTED IN A SUBJECT, IT IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE:
They don't realize how seriously their lives and their future may be impacted by the issue being studied. [h]
They don't see any immediate benefit for their daily lives. [d]
The teacher does not know the subject thoroughly enough to get the learners motivated. [a]
They are not getting enough practice or feedback during the learning process. [c]
That subject isn't a high priority for them personally; they are more interested in something else. [f]


12] DIFFERENCES AMONG ADULT LEARNERS:
Are relatively unimportant as long as the learners gain a common base of understanding through the educational experience. [v]
Enable them to learn best on their own time and in their own way, and should be valued and strongly supported. [y]
Are primarily due to differences in their life experiences, and will usually lead them to make different applications of new knowledge and skills to their own situations. [x]
Arise from their particular cultural and social situations, and are extremely relevant to the educational process. [z]
Will not interfere with their learning if each person is given adequate opportunity for practice and reinforcement. [w]


13] EVALUATION OF LEARNING OUTCOMES:
Is not of great importance and is not easily accomplished, since the impact of learning may not be evident until much later. [h]
Should be built into the educational process so that learners will continually receive feedback and can adjust their performance accordingly. [c]
Is best done by the learners themselves, for their own purposes. [f]
Lets a teacher know how much information and conceptual understanding each learner has acquired. [a]
Is best accomplished when the learner encounters a problem, either in the learning setting or the real world, and successfully resolves it. [d]


14] MY PRIMARY ROLE AS A TEACHER OF ADULTS IS TO:
Set clear expectations, guide learners through structured learning activities, and provide well-directed feedback. [w]
Introduce learners to a broad range of information and ways of thinking about the world. [v]
Help adults "learn how to learn" what is useful for their lives. [x]
Increase learners' awareness of social, cultural, economic, and/or political issues and help them learn how to have an impact on societal conditions that need to be changed. [z]
Facilitate, but not to direct, learning activities that are meaningful to each learner. [y]


15] IN THE END, IF ADULTS HAVE NOT LEARNED WHAT WAS TAUGHT:
They lacked appreciation for the subject matter or the teacher's knowledge, or they found the intellectual challenge too demanding. [a]
They need to repeat one or more educational activities until they can master the learning (or at least meet minimum standards). [c]
It's okay, because they probably learned something else that they considered just as interesting or important. [f]
They don't realize how the new knowledge will empower them to significantly impact the world in which they live. [h]
It is probably because they are unable to make practical application of what was taught to problems in their daily lives. [d]
